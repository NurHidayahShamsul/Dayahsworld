When I was in year 1, I was sent to a Chinese school in Kajang which is SRJK(C) YU HUA. 
I was sent to a Chinese school because I have basic in Chinese language specifically Mandarin, as I studied at
a Chinese kindergarten for two years. My aunt also knows Chinese so she is also one of the reason 
why I was sent to a Chinese school. I studied there until I was in year 6 and continue to SMJK(C) Yu Hua
for my form 1. I was actually struggling because I find it hard to learn and to focus in that school and 
my grades were very bad not only for Bahasa Cina but also for other subjects. At the end of 2014 my mom 
decided to transfer me to a new school. Eventhough many years has passed by, I would proudly say that I can still speak
Mandarin pretty fluently.

    After months of searching for new school, I got to transfer to SMKTJ2. This school is near my house and is just one
    minute away by car. I sometimes will walk to school because it takes around 3 minutes to arrive but on rainy or sunny days
    my mom or aunt would drove me to shcool as well as fetch me from school. Alhamdulillah in this school i finally get to focus 
    on my studies and get to be surrounded with good and unproblematic friends. The biggest achievement studying here is that I scored 
    my SPM with flying colours, I got 7A's for my SPM all thanks to my classmates, teachers and myself.

        In 2019, I was fortunate enough to continue my diploma in UiTM Kampus Rembau. It was my first time
        ever away from my mom and it was pretty heartbreaking but oh well life must go on because one way or another
        I still need to learn on being an independent woman. In fact Rembau-Kajang is only 1 hour away. Life in Rembau was 
        pretty good I would say, I get to learn many new stuff, get to know new friends from other states and many more.
        I enjoyed my time there. It has been 2 years since I went there all thanks to the the pandemic and I trully miss UiTM 
        Rembau. It is kind of sad that I did not get to finish my diploma there with my friends. I just hope that one day I can reunite
        again with my classmates.</p>
