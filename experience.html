While waiting for my SPM results, I decided to work as a 
part-time at Nike IOI City Mall Putrajaya. I had a tough time 
finding job at the time because many stores were either already 
full or did not pay a decent wage. I was fortunate enough that 
Nike called me for an interview after two months of looking and 
submitting my résumé to a number of other places and I was hired 
on the spot. I worked there for six months and gained much 
knowledge, as well as making many new friends. It was an 
absolutely great experience to be a part of that team.

    In July of 2020, I was having a three-month sem break from 
    uni. I made the decision to seek for a part-time work once 
    more in order to fill up my spare time while also earning 
    some money. I went for an interview at Boat Noodle Metropoint, 
    which is a neighbourhood shopping centre near my house. I 
    was hired and worked there for three months. It was challenging 
    and exhausting since it was my first time working in the F&B 
    sector, and I was responsible for not only preparing the 
    dishes, but also serving, cleaning, and attend customers. 
    In any case, I still enjoy working there and I gained a lot 
    of useful skills and experiences.

        On February 2021, I was on my semester break again and was 
        looking for a way to earn my income. I chose to seek for a 
        job at IOI City Mall in Putrajaya. A retail company called 
        Cotton On Kids, which sell children clothing, 
        called me for an interview, and I agreed. I accepted the 
        offer and chose to continue working there till now because
        all of my classes are now being held online due to the pandemic. 
        Being in my final year of diploma studies, I am only working 
        on weekends and public holidays, which would make things 
        quite chaotic for me if I were to work everyday. I personally 
        believe that this job is my favourite thus far because I 
        previously had retail experience, and I enjoy dealing with customers who are parents, as well as 
        seeing children in and around the stores brings me happiness.
