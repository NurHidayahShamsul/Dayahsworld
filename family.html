<h1><font color= "#f28f3b" face= "OCR A Std, monospace">The Four of Us</font></h1>

<pre><font color= "#00173d"> This is my small family!</font> 
    
In the photo on the right side is my small family. From the front on the left side 
is my mother, Hamidah and beside her is my gramdma which is my mother's mom 
and I call her Opah! 

<font color= "#595959">Moving on to the right is my father, Shamsul Nazri and known by many as "Kite". 
At the back the one holding flowers is my one and only sister, Nur Hazira and beside 
her is me!</font>

We live as family of four in a house in Kajang, Selangor. My father is just one year 
older than my mother. Both of them was born and raised in Kajang.

<font color= "#595959">Back in 2010, for the first time in our lives we are experiencing difuculties in many 
different ways. My father was diagnosed with stroke. All the left side of his body is not 
functioning including the left eye, left hand and legs and even his left brain.

At that time he was our only source of income because my mother stop working 4 
years back in order to be a fulltime housewife and to focus on me and my sister.

It was a very hard for us as if or world has been turned upside down because it completely 
changed our lives 360 degree. I had to live with my aunt and uncle as our family was not 
financially stable at that time.</font>

I pity my mother so much during that time she was very struggling to take care of my father 
and us. She then decided to baby sit her new born nephew and every month my aunt will 
pay my mother for taking care of her son.

<font color= "#595959">My mother then took laundry wages and do laundry for her sister including washing and drying 
their clothes.She did many side job in order to financially support us. She then decided to 
learn about contractor.</font>

My father is a contractor and has his own company, so my mother decided to learn to be a 
contractor and took over the company. Alhamdulillah with her strong courage to learn new 
knowledge for the sake of the family, we get to live a comfartable life now.

<font color= "#595959">As for my father, 12 years has passed by and he is still having the stroke but has improved a lot 
since then. He can walk by himself using a stick, can eat by himself and he can even drive but 
only in short distance.</font>

Thats' pretty much sum up the story of my family. There are a lot more i want to tell and if I could 
I would, trust me :) but for now i guess this is the only thing I am comfartable telling you guys. 
If you guys want to know more about me, you can always hit me up on any of my socials just click on 
"contact" at the menu section above this page!

<pre>Hamidah Ibrahim. Yes that is my mother. She was born on 24th October 1977 which makes her 45 years old this year.
She is not only my mother but she is also my strength and my bestfriend. I talk to her about everything, I even share a 
room and sleep with her! She has been through a lot through out the years but I have never seen her given up, not even 
once. That is why i respect her not only as mother but also as a strong woman. All of the things that we have now are all
because of her and she should take the full credits for it. I could not be the woman I am today without her guiding me this
whole time and I am a strong woman because a strong woman raised me :). Gosh I could talk about you all day ma! If there's 
one thing that I could tell you it is that, you have raised me so well and I know that you have doubted yourself in the past
whether you are a good mother to us and let me tell you that YOU ARE ma. I am writing this straight from my heart. Thank you 
for all of your sacrifices mama, I love you.</pre>

<pre>This is my only sister, Nur Hazirah. She is known by the name, Haz. She was born on the 22nd May of 2000. We are 
super close which make sense because she is only one year older than me. We share everything together to clothes, makeups
and even secrets! She knows every little thing about and I do too about her. </pre>
